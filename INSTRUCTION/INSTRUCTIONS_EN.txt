Running the Program:
--------------------

1. Connect the Anemobarometer and the computer to the same Wi-Fi network;
2. Open the "main" folder. Inside the folder, run the file named "main" with administrator privileges;
3. During the first launch of the program, the necessary libraries will be loaded. This may take a few minutes;

Additional Explanations:
------------------------

1. Graphs
    1.1 In an open browser window, the Dash page containing 4 graphs. The first one shows real data from the device.
    1.2 2-4 graphs are obtained with the help of a number generator and only demonstrate the visual functionality of the program.
    Later, graphs 2-4 can be replaced by displaying real data from devices of this model.

2. Logging
    2.1 At the same time with displaying the data graph in the "Wind Rose" form, the data is writing to a csv file
    2.2 The file name is YYYY-MM-DD.csv(today date). The file is located in the logs folder inside the Anemobarometer interface folder.
    Only the first (real) graph are being recorded.

3. Warning Window
    4.1. The program contains functionality that allows to display a warning window in case the wind speed exceeds the selected limit value.
    4.2. Currently, the warning window appears for 5 seconds when the wind speed is > 17.5 m/s.
    4.3. The warning window also displays the wind speed that triggered its appearance.
